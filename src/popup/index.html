<div class="mainPopup">
  <h1>Hello extensionizr!</h1>
  <p>
    To shut this popup down, edit the manifest file and remove the "default
    popup" key. To edit it, just edit ext/browser_action/browser_action.html.
    The CSS is there, too.

  <button id="delete-local-storage">DELETE LOCAL DATA!</button>
